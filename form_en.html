<h2>Morphosyntactic Questionnaire</h2>
<p><strong>A. V. Zimmerling, N. V. Serdobolskaya, G. I. Kustova, E. Yu. Ivanova</strong><br>
© 2024</p>

<h3>For the RSF project application "Control and Raising in the Languages of Eurasia" (instructions for project participants)</h3>

<ul style="line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
<li>When describing a language of the Russian Federation or a European language, fill out the attached questionnaire.</li>
<li>For positive answers to questionnaire questions, provide supporting examples.</li>
<li>For negative answers to a question, if possible, illustrate the grammatical constraint observed in the given language with a sentence marked with an asterisk, cf. Russ. *Василию приятны читать книги</li>
<li>Note discrepancies between the terminology adopted in the linguistic tradition devoted to the given language and the terminology you adhere to. Illustration example 1: some form in language L is traditionally called "supine" or "masdar", but you categorize it differently. Illustration example 2: in the grammar of language L, some elements are called "suffixes" or "prefixes", but you, based on distributional analysis or other considerations, qualify them as "clitics".</li>
<li>When filling out section 11, provide lists of verbs of the designated thematic groups and indicate their meanings in Marr quotes. Reference to the source of interpretation/translation is optional. Illustration: Arab. kād-a, karaba 'to be about to', 'to be on the verge of' &lt;[Haddad 2012]&gt;.</li>
